I chose this article because most of us will be joining the work force after graduation as a software engineer/developer. Therefore, I found it interesting to read up on 10 philosophies for software engineers. This article was written in 2016, so I don't know how accurate it is now. However, I still found some interesting points. One thing that stoof out to me was that "as a software engineer, your downside is fundamentally capped". It says that the "high demand for engineers isn't dissipating any time soon". "The job marker is really good right now" and I hope it continues to be this way.
