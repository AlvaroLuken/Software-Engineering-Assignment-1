- I chose this article because most of us will be joining the work force after graduation as a software engineer/developer. Therefore, I found it interesting to read up on 10 philosophies for software engineers. This article was written in 2016, so I don't know how accurate it is now. However, I still found some interesting points. One thing that stoof out to me was that "as a software engineer, your downside is fundamentally capped". It says that the "high demand for engineers isn't dissipating any time soon". "The job marker is really good right now" and I hope it continues to be this way.


# Comments:

- I really enjoyed reading this article. I am of the thought that tech people, to sound snobby as hell, such as ourselves should actively look to get more in touch with the philosophies of the disruptiveness of our field. This article provides some good advice but I am glad you acknowledged that it is possibly a bit old and outdated (due to the industry).
